# PythonBot

Python script running bot 
Contains 3 main commands

!help : display help with the commands

!ping : A simple command to check if the bot is alive. It will normally respond by "pong"

!python : begins the python executing process. Just type this command, send the message, wait for the bot waiting message, then write your code in the next message. You can write it blank, or use the Discord python code markdown with :

\`\`\`python

your code

\`\`\`

The bot will answer with the python output of your program

Please note that the input() command will not work for the moment.


Please do not run the bot on your own ! Please use https://top.gg/bot/689934968285298808 instead
